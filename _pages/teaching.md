I currently serve as an Instructor/Mentor for the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) high school program for the 2022-23 academic year at Stony Brook University. As part of this position, I am designing and teaching a curricula about biological and physical oceanography to high school girls and will be mentoring them through an independent research project. 

Over the past several years I have led informal workshops and have mentored students in data analysis using R. I have also served as a TA for the Diving Research Methods course at Northeastern University.
