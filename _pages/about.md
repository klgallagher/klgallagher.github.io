Hello! My name is Katherine (Hudson) Gallagher. I am currently an NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Research Program (PRFP) Fellow at Stony Brook University. In collaboration with Dr. Heather Lynch and her lab group, my current project is investigating how the potential retention or accumulation of Antarctic krill may play a role in where penguin colonies are located along the West Antarctic Peninsula using a combination of physical ocean modeling and penguin colony census data from the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD). 

This website is currently underconstruction so apologies for the mess. Please check in again in the future!
