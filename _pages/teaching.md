## Teaching

I currently serve as an Instructor/Mentor for the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) high school program for the 2022-23 academic year at Stony Brook University. As part of this position, I am teaching a [curricula I designed](https://github.com/klgallagher/klgallagher.github.io/files/10263390/lessonplan_KG_Fall2022_updated.docx)

I have also taken courses on teaching, including Scientists Teaching Science in the summer of 2022. [Here is an example syllabus](https://github.com/klgallagher/klgallagher.github.io/files/10263393/syllabus_kg.docx)

## Outreach
In my opinion, outreach is a critical (and the funnest!) part of being a scientist! I love outreach and am constantly looking out for more outreach activities to engage all groups in my science. I am always happy to come speak to classrooms, clubs, etc. Please reach out if you are interested in having me speak to your group!
