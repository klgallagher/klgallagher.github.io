Hello! My name is Katherine (Hudson) Gallagher. I am currently an NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Research Program (PRFP) Fellow at Stony Brook University. In collaboration with Dr. Heather Lynch and her lab group, my current project is investigating how the potential retention or accumulation of Antarctic krill may play a role in where penguin colonies are located along the West Antarctic Peninsula using a combination of physical ocean modeling and penguin colony census data from the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD). 

Broadly, my research interests include the impacts of physical oceanography on species distributions and how these bio-physical interactions may drive marine species biogeography, food webs, and ecological interactions. While my dissertation focused on a biological hotspot in the Antarctic, I am interested in answering these types of questions in a variety of ecosystems, using a combination of in-situ observations, physical ocean models, and ecological modeling techniques.
