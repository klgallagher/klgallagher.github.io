Broadly, my research interests include the impacts of physical oceanography on species distributions and how these bio-physical interactions may drive marine species biogeography, food webs, and ecological interactions. While my dissertation focused on a biological hotspot in the Antarctic, I am interested in answering these types of questions in a variety of ecosystems, using a combination of in-situ observations, physical ocean models, and ecological modeling techniques.
