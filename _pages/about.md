###### About Me
My name is Katherine Gallagher. I am a biological and physical oceanographer interested in how physical phenomenona control the distributions of prey, their predators, and most recently, marine pollutants. 

I am currently an NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Research Program (PRFP) Fellow at Stony Brook University. In collaboration with Dr. Heather Lynch, my current project is investigating how the potential accumulation of Antarctic krill may play a role in where penguin colonies are located along the West Antarctic Peninsula using a combination of physical ocean modeling and penguin colony census data from the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD). 

###### Contact Information
The best way to reach me is via email at Katherine.L.Hudson@stonybrook.edu. I look forward to hearing from you!
