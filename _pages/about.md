### About Me
My research examines how physical phenomenona control the distributions of prey, their predators, and marine pollutants. My work has ranged on studying using physical ocean models to study Antarctic krill and how their retention drives penguin colony distributions to using autonomous underwater vehicles and passive acoustic monitoring to understand baleen whale distributions in the New York Bight. My most recent project involves using physical ocean models to predict habitat suitability for fish in the Northwest Atlantic!
