Broadly, my research interests include the impacts of physical oceanography on species distributions and how these bio-physical interactions may drive marine species biogeography, food webs, and ecological interactions. While my dissertation focused on a biological hotspot in the Antarctic, I am interested in answering these types of questions in a variety of ecosystems, using a combination of in-situ observations, physical ocean models, and ecological modeling techniques.

## Current Projects 

#### Penguin Response to Oceanographic Features
For my postdoc, I am studying how penguin colony size, reproductive success, and location may be driven by oceanographic features such as high retention and or influx of simulated krill. I am using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to simulate the physical oceanography around the West Antarctic Peninsula. Within this model, I am simulated krill vertical migration behaviors to help understand krill distributions and how the retention and/or influx of simulated krill may be related to penguin colony metrics. I plan to utilize satellite-based penguin diet estimates to determine if penguins are utilizing the areas of modeled high retention and/or influx of simulated krill. This project is funded by the NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program. 

## Previous Projects

#### Project SWARM 
Project SWARM was an interdisciplinary, collaborative effort between the University of Delaware, Rutgers University, Old Dominion University, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Oregon State University, and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program team to determine the physical drivers of an Antarctic biological hotspot, located at Palmer Deep Canyon. As part of my dissertation, I analyzed data from autonomous underwater gliders, acoustic moorings, and the ROMS model to describe a potential mechanism driving the biological hotspot. This project was funded by NSF. 

#### Bioluminescence in Delaware Bay
I participated in a research cruise and glider deployments outside of Delaware Bay examining the distributions of bioluminescent organisms on the continental shelf.
