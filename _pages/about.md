### About Me
My research examines how physical phenomenona control the distributions of prey, their predators, and most recently, marine pollutants. 

I am currently a senior postdoctoral associate at Stony Brook University, with a dual appointment in the Institute for Advanced Computational Science (IACS) and the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS). In collaboration with Dr. Heather Lynch in IACS, I am investigating how the potential accumulation of Antarctic krill may play a role in where penguin colonies are located along the West Antarctic Peninsula using a combination of physical ocean modeling and penguin colony census data from the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD). This project is funded by an NSF Office of Polar Programs Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. 

In SoMAS, I am working on a project funded by the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) in collaboration with Dr. Lesley Thorne. This project uses gliders as a platform to monitor baleen whale distributions in the New York Bight using passive acoustic monitoring. I am invegistgating the distributions of our target species, including the critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, in the region, as well as building habitat selection models for these species in the New York Bight and beyond.  

### Contact Information
The best way to reach me is via email at Katherine.L.Hudson@stonybrook.edu. I look forward to hearing from you!

### What's Next?
I am current on the academic job market, seeking tenure-track opportunities for a Fall 2025 start. If you know of any opportunities that may be a good fit, please reach out!
